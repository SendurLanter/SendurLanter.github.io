Collaborative Social-Aware Video Caching in Edge Network
------
<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive video streaming, Collaborative caching, Edge computing, Social network</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory",* **2019**

In this work, I first adopt a time series model to quantify users' interaction patterns, and then mathematically formulated information dissemination among users in the online social network. Afterward, I developed a intact video caching and adaptation framework that utilizes users' viewing history, users' channel condition and video dissemination state in the community to determine 1) collaborative caching decision among multiple edge servers, and 2) real-time video transcoding decision with an aim to optimize users' QoE.

### Demo of key concept:

In the figure, the black line means the message exchange between users and the green/red nodes represent the users have/haven't seen a certain video. All of the user data are collected in real-world traces. <br/><br/><br/>

<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive 360° video streaming, Viewport prediction, VR, Edge computing</font>

*Side project,* **2020**

In this work, I enhanced QoE and bandwidth utilization of 360° video streaming service by adaptively determining encoding bitrate of each tile based on prediction of user's Field of View (FoV). In addition, edge servers are considered to provide caching and computing capacity to reduce the experienced latency of VR devices.

This figure shows the actual/predicted FoV of users during streaming process, where the data are collected in the real-world trace. <br/><br/><br/>

*Course project in "Introduction to Wireless and Mobile Networking",* **2019**

In this work, by modeling user mobility, inter-cell interference from D2D and BS2D communication, and wireless fading channels, I implement the simulation for a few D2D caching schemes, where each device can prefetch popular contents from the base stations (BS) and share them with proximate peers.

### Demo of key concept:

The red/blue lines represent BS2D and D2D transmission respectively. Also, the flash green point denotes a content request, obeying the Poisson process. <br/><br/><br/>

*Course project in "Introduction to Electronic Design Automation",* **2020**

In this work, I studied and compared state-of-the-art researches in resource-constrained scheduling algorithms, which aims to minimize total completion time of dependant tasks.

The figure shows the scheduling decision of Deep Reinforcement Learning method. Green/blue nodes signify unscheduled/finished tasks respectively and the arrows in the directed graph are dependencies between tasks. <br/><br/><br/>

Parallel Task Offloading for Augmented Realty in Dynamic MEC Slice
------
<font color=green>Tag: AR, Task offloading, Network slicing</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory",* **2020**

This is a simple AR application I made for demonstrating our 5G testbed. The computation tasks of AR apps (e.g. object detection, object projection and rendering) are offloaded to our proximate edge servers for execution. I also realize a dynamic network slicing system that can adjust Docker-based isolated resources based on predicted workload.

Interest-based QoE-Driven Video Caching and Adaptation in Edge Network
------
<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive video streaming, Caching, Edge computing, collaborative filtering</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory",* **2019**

In this work, I developed an interest-based QoE-driven partial video caching scheme in the edge network, where the caching decisions are made depended on users' viewing history and current backhaul bandwidth. In addition, edge servers are deployed to perform real-time transcoding on cached videos to serve users with time-varying downlink capacity.
