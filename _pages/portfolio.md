Parallel Task Offloading for Augmented Realty in Dynamic MEC System
------
<font color=green>Tag: AR, Task offloading, Network slicing</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory", 2020*

This is a simple application I made for demonstrating our 5G testbed. The computation tasks of AR apps (e.g. object detection, projection and rendering) are offloaded to our proximate edge server for execution. We also realize a dynamic network slicing system with Docker based on workload prediction.

MEC-Assisted FoV-Aware Adaptive 360° Video Streaming for VR
------
<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive 360° video streaming, Viewport prediction, VR, Edge computing</font>

*Side project, 2020*

In this work, I enhanced QoE and bandwidth utilization of 360° video streaming service by predicting Field of View (FoV) of the user. In addition, edge servers are considered to provide caching and computing capacity to aid the VR device.

### Demo of key concept:

This figure shows the actual/predicted FoV in the head-mounted display (HMD), where the data are collected in the real-world trace. [Click to see details](https://sendurlanter.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-7/) <br/><br/><br/><br/>

Collaborative Social-Aware Video Caching in Edge Network
------
<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive video streaming, Collaborative caching, Edge computing, Social network</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory", 2019*

In this work, I mathematically formulated the information dissemination process through interaction on social media. Then, I developed a heuristic algorithm that utilizes users' viewing history, users' channel condition and video dissemination state in the community to determine collaborative caching decision among edge servers with an aim to optimize users' QoE.

### Demo of key concept:

In the figure, the black line means the message exchange between users and the green/red nodes represent the users have/haven't seen a certain video. All of the user data are collected in real-world traces. [Click to see details](https://sendurlanter.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/) <br/><br/><br/><br/>

FPGA High Level Synthesis: A Survey and Implementation on Operation Scheduling Algorithms
------
<font color=green>Tag: Dependant task scheduling, RL, Genetic algorithm</font>

*Course project in "Introduction to Electronic Design Automation", 2020*

In this work, I studied and compared state-of-the-art researches in resource-constrained scheduling algorithms, which aims to minimize total completion time of dependant tasks.

### Demo of key concept:

<img src="http://SendurLanter.github.io/files/HLS.gif"  width="300" height="225" align=center> 

The figure shows the scheduling decision of Deep Reinforcement Learning method. Green/blue nodes signify unscheduled/finished tasks respectively and the arrows in the directed graph are dependencies between tasks.

Analysis of D2D caching schemes in Heterogeneous Network
------
<font color=green>Tag: D2D communication, Caching, Heterogeneous network</font>

*Course project in "Introduction to Wireless and Mobile Networking", 2019*

In this work, by modeling interference incurring by BS2D, D2D communication and the corresponding wireless channels, I implement the simulation for different D2D caching schemes with user mobility where each device can prefetch popular contents from the base stations (BS) and share them with proximate peers.

### Demo of key concept:

<img src="http://SendurLanter.github.io/files/demo.gif"  width="300" height="225" align=center>

The red/blue lines represent BS2D and D2D transmission respectively. Also, the flash green point denotes a content request, obeying the Poisson process. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

Interest-based QoE-Driven Video Caching and Adaptation in Edge Network
------
<font color=green>Tag: Adaptive video streaming, Caching, Edge computing, collaborative filtering</font>

*Research work in "Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory", 2019*

In this work, I developed an interest-based partial video caching scheme in the edge network, where the caching decisions are made depended on users' viewing history and current backhaul bandwidth. In this way, users' QoE can be further improved.
