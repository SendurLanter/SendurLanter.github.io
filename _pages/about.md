Welcome!
======
My name is Chih-Ho Hsu (許智和). Currently, I'm pursuing the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with National Taiwan University (NTU) while serving research assistant in Wireless and Mobile Networking Laboratory under the instruction of Prof. Hung-Yu Wei.

My research interests include related issues in wireless communication and networking: Resource allocation and management, Social network, Edge/Fog computing, Multimedia streaming and Virtual reality.
