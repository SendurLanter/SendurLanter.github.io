My name is **Chih-Ho Hsu (許智和)**. Currently, I'm pursuing the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with National Taiwan University (NTU) while serving research assistant under supervision the instruction of Prof. **Hung-Yu Wei**. My research interests include related issues in Wireless Communication and Computer Network: edge/fog computing, multimedia streaming, caching, computation offloading, social network,  and virtual reality.
