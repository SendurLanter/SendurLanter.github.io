Welcome!
======
My name is **Chih-Ho Hsu (許智和)**. Currently, I'm pursuing the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with National Taiwan University (NTU) while serving research assistant under supervision the instruction of Prof. [**Hung-Yu Wei**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7tj-HgAAAAJ&hl=en) in Wireless Mobile Network Lab ([link](http://wmnlab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/lab/index.html)). 

My research interests include related issues in Wireless Communication and Computer Network: edge/fog computing, multimedia streaming, caching, computation offloading, social network,  and virtual reality.
